Templates for getting any image to work as a 360 photosphere or panorama on Facebook

[Facebook now allows still 360 photospheres and panoramas](http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/introducing-360-photos-on-facebook/) but is very particular about what metadata is required to get them to display correctly. 

The included .xmp file can be used to inject the necessary photosphere metadata in Photoshop. 

The included templates can be used as base layers to place your own content on top of. Just make sure to save your file as a .jpg and include the original metadata.
